# Contributing

Great, you are interested in contributing to the package.

To get acquainted with the code base, you can check out our [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenSourceEconomics/grmpy/issues) for some immediate and clearly defined tasks. For more involved contributions, please see our roadmap below. All submissions are required to follow this project-agnostic [contribution guide](http://www.contribution-guide.org/).

## Roadmap

We aim for improvements to the `grmpy` package in four domains: Objects of Interest, Estimation Methods, and Numerical Methods.

### Objects of Interest

* Adding marginal surplus and marginal cost parameters as presented by {cite}`Eisenhauer2015`

### Estimation Methods

* Implement polynomial and local-instrumental variable estimation as outlined by {cite}`HeUrVy06`

* Implementing capability to control for unobservables by adding a factor structure assumption as in {cite}`Eisenhauer2013`

### Program Structure

* Refactoring code to incorporate elements of object-oriented programming

### Numerical Methods

* Exploring alternative optimization algorithms to address large estimation tasks
