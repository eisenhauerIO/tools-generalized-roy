ESTIMATION:
  # Estimation method: "parametric" or "semiparametric"
  method: parametric

  # Optimizer for parametric estimation
  # Options: BFGS, POWELL, L-BFGS-B
  optimizer: BFGS

  # Maximum iterations for optimization
  max_iterations: 10000

  # Convergence tolerance
  tolerance: 1.0e-6

  # Semiparametric options
  # Number of grid points for MTE evaluation
  gridsize: 500

  # Propensity score range for common support
  ps_range: [0.005, 0.995]

  # Minimum sample size for semiparametric estimation
  # Design Decision: 100 is conservative based on simulation studies
  # showing unreliable local polynomial estimates with fewer points
  min_sample_size: 100
